# What is this? How did I get here?
First of all, hi. You probably got here when looking for optimized Java code. Well, you came to a place that tried to implement that.
This is the second part of the Software Laboratory 3 project in my degree's course. Welcome.

## Wait wait wait wait. I've seen this readme somewhere. Talk.

Yes, you've seen a version of it in C, probably [here](https://github.com/jhugobb/LI3_C), and I'm just too lazy to make a new one. Small modifications tho.
You can find details of the problem there.

## Java? So mainstream. I don't even know how to run it.
It is what it is, and the teachers demanded it was in Java. We are on your side.
To run it, in the main directory type `./run.sh` in your bash/shell

## How did you make it? Any special unusual things?
We used STAX, as requested by the teachers to parse the xml file, and later loaded the information into a Data Structure, in our case, 2 TreeMaps with TreeSets. Yes, just as original, after all, it's the same guys doing it.

### How in the hell did you make the process of 4M lines of xml smooth and fast as the Flash?
We asked him how, he is a nice guy.
Also Java it's kinda optimized, so the work wasn't much.
If you want to see a lightning fast version tho, head over [here](https://github.com/p3rsephone/LI3), it's a friend's version of the same version, and damn it is fast. Check both the C and Java versions, you won't regret it.

## Well I need to donate my entire savings to the authors! This changed my life! Can I know who they are?
Well, thank these guys. They are awesome. And keep your money, wast it on something that cleans up your room for you.

### There is also a C version that is faster, but is as pretty as this one.
